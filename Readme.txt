Travel Agency Flight Reservation Management System
	
	This program is a flight reservation management system for a airport. First, it gets all the flights and airports 
listed in the flights.csv and reservations.csv file. Then the user can search for a flight, by selecting the originating
and destination airpots and the day of the flight (could be any day as well). Then the user selects a flight from the 
displayed list and fills in the name and citizenship and click reserve to reserve a flight. In the reservations tab, 
we can search for reservations by code, name and airline. Then, the name and citizenship can be updated or the status can
be changed for a soft delete which sets the status to inactive and frees up a flight for that airline and day. The flight
can be serached again and the status can be set to active and the seats available will be updated.

Since the assignment did not specify how the name would be entered, the first name and last name can not have a space in 
between. We also added a space on the combo boxes as the default option in the boxes was not being selected.

The program can be run by opening a command prompt and running the jar file, Assignment2.jar .
